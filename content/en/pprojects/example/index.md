This page contains descriptions of a collections of projects I worked on over the course of my graduate studies. This page will be updated with the different projects codes in the near future, as well as R packages that I am in the process of building for tensor data analysis.

      <li> Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between positive and negative customer reviews.</li>
      <li> Wrote a Python program which reads in reviews, performs data cleaning and feature extraction and for each review decides whether it holds a positive or a negative sentiment.</li>

      <li> Implemented an EM algorithm in R which sequentially locates and estimates the magnitude of the effects of 176 markers on blood pressure in mice.</li>
      <li>  Performed a permutation test to compute the critical value for the test statistics.</li>
      <li>  Used a hierarchical model approach with a non-informative prior on the tuning parameter to implementBayesian Lasso in R which allowed for simultaneously testing the location and effect of all markers at once.</li>
      <li>  Used a Gibb sampler to sample from the full conditional posterior of 341 parameters and hyper-parameters.</li>

Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions using Weighted Logistic Regression
 Used credit card transactions data from a major bank to train a logistic regression for detecting fraudulent
transactions in Python.
 Performed data cleaning and feature selections.
 Applied L2 regularization on logistic regression and adjusted for unbalanced number of fraudulent and
non-fraudulent cases in training data using weights to improve classier performance and reduce bias.
      <li> Validated model performance through leave one out cross validation prediction accuracy, ROC curve, specifcity and sensitivity analysis.</li>

      <li>Built tools for automating data cleaning and analysis in SAS and R and created instruction manuals to help CATME system users run analyses independently.</li>   
      <li> Run live demo of new method for CATME users from different countries.</li>   
      <li> New tools are to be integrated into the CATME system which is currently deployed to more than 1 million users from 80 countries.</li>
