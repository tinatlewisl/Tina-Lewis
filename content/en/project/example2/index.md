    <span style="font-size:13px;">
      <li> Analysis of a 5.5 years longitudinal health claim data trough a provider/patient social network analysis.</li>
      <li> Investigated the effect of providers network graphs measures (degree, centrality and betweeness) on very sparse patient level count data.</li>
      <li> Modelled the provider network graph effects using a zero inflated Poisson model.</li>
      <li> Established the covariance structure of the various models through a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method to caputure the depentence between patients in the same network clusters.</li>
      <li> Used boostrap method to compute confidence region of various statistics.</li>
