      <li> Used a factorial design within a randomized control block design to model relationship between treatment and horseweed height.</li>
      <li> Conducted a Dose Response statistical analysis (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538269/"> ED50 </a> ) to study efficacy of 3 herbicides for controlling horseweed plants.</li>
      <li> Wrote function which estimates the confidence intervals for the difference in dose response (ED50) using boostrap method.</li>

    <ul>
    <span style="font-size:13px;">
      <li>  Performed a retrospective case-control study data analysis of patients with diabetes seen/not seen by pharmacists to determine the potential role of pharmacists in DR progression</li>
      <li>  Wrote code to automate data retreival, cleaning and preprocessing from REDcap database</li>
      <li>  Conducted analysis comparing control and treatment group distribution. </li>
      <li>  Modelled the odds of rethinopathy worsening in control and treatment groups using a weigthed logistic regression controlling for demographic and health background variables.</li>
     <li> Conducted power analysis to determine sample size for a follow-up prospective case-control study.</li>
      
      <li> Established the covariance structure of the various models through a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method to caputure the depentence between patients in the same network clusters.</li>
      <li> Used boostrap method to compute confidence region of various statistics.</li>
      <li> Assisted client with code writting for models and results interpretation and reporting.</li>
