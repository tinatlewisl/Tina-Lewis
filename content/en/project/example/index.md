      <ul>
      <span style="font-size:13px;">
      <li>Developed metrics and statistical methods for accessing the quality of ratings data generated by the CATME system.</li>   
      <li>Built tools for automating data cleaning and analysis in SAS and R and created instruction manuals to help CATME system users run analyses independently.</li>   
      <li> Run live demo of new method for CATME users from different countries.</li>   
      <li> New tools are to be integrated into the CATME system which is currently deployed to more than 1 million users from 80 countries.</li>

    <ul>
    <span style="font-size:13px;">
      <li> Used high frequency ultrasound aneurysm data to develop prediction models of both aneurysm formation and growth trend.</li>
      <li> Used a quadratic discriminant analysis and logistic regression to build two statistical models to predict disease status.</li>
      <li> Validated model performance through leave one out cross validation prediction accuracy, ROC curve, specifcity and sensitivity analysis.</li>

    <span style="font-size:13px;">
      <li> Analysis of a 5.5 years longitudinal health claim data trough a provider/patient social network analysis .</li>
      <li> Investigated the effect of providers network graphs measures (degree, centrality and betweeness) on very sparse patient level count data.</li>
      <li> Modelled the provider network graph effects using a zero inflated Poisson model.</li>
      <li> Established the covariance structure of the various models through a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method to caputure the depentence between patients in the same network clusters.</li>
      <li> Used boostrap method to compute confidence region of various statistics.</li>
