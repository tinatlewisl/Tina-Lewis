This section contains a non-exhaustive list of Statistics consulting projects I worked on which subject matter relates to the field of engineering. Click to see the projects and their description. A link to the final project outcome is provided when the client allows for it.

 **Engineering Teamwork Ratings Quality Assessment**  
 <span style="color:grey; font-family:courier; font-size:13px;">August 2017 -- May 2018</span>  
> * Developed metrics and statistical methods for accessing the quality of ratings data generated by the
> CATME system.  
> * Built tools for automating data cleaning and analysis in SAS and R and created instruction manuals to help
> CATME system users run analyses independently.  
> * Run live demo of new method for CATME users from different countries.  
> * New tools are to be integrated into the CATME system which is currently deployed to more than 1 million
> users from 80 countries.
