- Developed metrics and statistical methods for accessing the quality of ratings data generated by the CATME system. 
- Built tools for automating data cleaning and analysis in SAS and R and created instruction manuals to help CATME system users run analyses independently.  
- Run live demo of new method for CATME users from different countries.  
- New tools are to be integrated into the CATME system which is currently deployed to more than 1 million users from 80 countries.
